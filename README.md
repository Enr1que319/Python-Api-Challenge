## Introduction

In this project the climate was thoroughly analyzed in order to find patterns. This is divided into two:
- WeatherPy
- VacationPy

Each project have the conclusions in the jupyter notebooks

## Data

The data was provided by [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## WeatherPy

In this part of the project a python scripts were created to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this simple Python libraries were used, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

The objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

- Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
- Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
